Hi! Welcome to my blog, Super Save Slot. I'm Richard, and I've been playing video games all my life.

Why does this blog exist? The short answer is because **I've been playing a crap ton of games lately, and I have so many thoughts that I want to share**, from cool level designs to touching story moments to infuriating mechanics.

The longer answer: since I was a kid, I've always had my nose buried into a game, but my playing habits always tilted toward depth instead of breadth. That is, I'd spend hundreds of hours playing Pokemon Platinum or Fire Emblem Awakening or TF2 as opposed to a couple dozen different titles.

In college, I didn't play many new titles. Instead, I almost exclusively immersed myself in Super Smash Bros. Melee—a game released in 2001 with a surprisingly thriving competitive scene today—as well as Dance Dance Revolution—a game almost exclusively available at a dingy arcade on a random street in Manhattan, where I'd sweat till midnight.

Since graduating college, and by extension, being stuck at home due to COVID-19, I've had the privilege of having lots of time (and boredom) on my hands. So I did what I've longed to do all my life: binge a bunch of different games for days on end.

Anyway, I'll use this blog to document some reviews, thoughts, and musings on these games. There's really no limits on subject matter, other than what's on my mind. I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts as much as I enjoyed putting them together!
